[This interactive map](http://andresarau.com/shiny/covid19mx/) is a personal and voluntary project that aims to track confirmed cases of #covid19 in each Mexican municipality. The map automatically updates in real-time using official data from the Mexican government.



*Feel free to enter the map, click on a municipality to see how many of its residents have tested positive for covid19, or look at the charts that show the daily evolution of covid19 in Mexico*
