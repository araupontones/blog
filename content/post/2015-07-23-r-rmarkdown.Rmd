I am writting this because it took me some long nights and days to try to figure out how to get started with blogdown. Hopefuly this post helps some others just like these posts have helped me:

[Yihui Xie's fantastic blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html),
[Alison Hill's amazing step by step](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/),
and, [Collin Quirk's super ueful guide to upload blogdown into Digital Ocean](http://colinquirk.com/blogdown-on-digitalocean/)



## In GitHUB

1. Create a repositary, name it as you want and enable a README
2. Click on the green buton "Clone or download"


## In your terminal

1. Open git bash, select the local directory where you want to clone the GitHub repo
2. `git clone https://github.com/araupontones/blog.git`

## In R studio 

1. Create a project in the local folder where the repo was cloned
2. `Install.packages("blogdown")`
3. Create  new site and choose a theme `blogdown::new_site(theme = "nanxstats/hugo-tanka", theme_example = TRUE)`

## In your cloned folder 

Check all the directories that were created when you created the site and configure the congig.toml

## In DigitalOcean

I followed [Collin Quirk's approach](http://colinquirk.com/blogdown-on-digitalocean/) which is very simple:

"Install nstall nginx `apt-get install nginx` and pandoc `apt-get install pandoc`. Start an interactive R session (by typing `R`) and install blogdown `install.packages("blogdown")` followed by hugo `blogdown::install_hugo()`. That is all you need to do in terms of setting up blogdow."


1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you will clone your GitHub repo.
2. `git clone https://github.com/araupontones/blog.git`
3. Copy the files like this `sudo cp -r public/. /var/www/html/.`

*et voila!* your website is up and running!!!
